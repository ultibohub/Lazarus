## Lazarus IDE (Ultibo Edition)

This repository contains the Ultibo edition of the Lazarus IDE.

Based originally on Lazarus 1.6RC1 with changes to support the Ultibo target and remove unwanted items which are not relevant to building applications with Ultibo core.

To build the IDE from source the process is the same as the Lazarus documentation with the released version built using:

make clean all

from within the top level directory.

Note that you do not need to download the Lazarus source to use Ultibo core, the neccessary parts of the source along with the compiled binaries are all included in the Ultibo core installer download.

For more information see the Ultibo Wiki at https://ultibo.org/wiki/Main_Page
